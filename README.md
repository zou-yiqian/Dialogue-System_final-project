# Dialogue-System_final-project

Background:
Let's have a guess. If you are catched into a nuthouse, but you are a normal person, how could you escape this place?
In this background, I assumed that system is doctor. It will ask three question to users each round. If user could correct two, he/she could be released.

Technicalities:
Rasa platform. MemoizationPolicy, KerasPolicy, FallbackPolicy and FormPolicy was used.

Challenges:
There is a lot of new functions in rasa. It spend me a lot of time to read the document. Still there will be a lot of problem in the process of coding.
But I try to deal with most of them by looking the community of rasa and learn how others deal with the similar problem.
Relation to course contents:
Form and Action part. I used this to build the main part of the code.

Future work:
It could not understand user very well. In the future, it could add more sentences in nlu.md.
Now, I use the way of brain teaser to decide if user should be release. But it could be changed to more chanllenge way in the future.
